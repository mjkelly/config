My configs, for setting up new personal machines.

deploy.sh is a convenient deployment script.

Some configs reference excluded files ending in ".localonly". These contain
authentication information, etc, and are .gitignore'd. They must be manually
added.

Some configs contain $USERNAME$, $PASSWORD$, and other pseudo-variables. You
must replace those manually.

The 'initial_install_packages' file contains a list of packages to be installed
(deploy.sh uses aptitude to install them). Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
