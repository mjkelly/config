My configs, for setting up new personal machines.

deploy.sh is a convenient, though crude, deployment script. (I could probably
use the 'dotfiles' program for this now, but I didn't know about 'dotfiles'
then and this repo appears to predate it.)

Some configs reference excluded files ending in ".localonly". These contain
authentication information, etc, and are .gitignore'd. They must be manually
added.

Some configs contain $USERNAME$, $PASSWORD$, and other pseudo-variables. You
must replace those manually. My local username is 'mkelly', and that is
floating around as well.

The 'initial_install_packages' file contains a list of packages to be installed
(deploy.sh uses aptitude to install them). Lines beginning with '#' are comments.
