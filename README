# configs

My configs, for setting up new personal machines.

deploy.sh is a convenient, though crude, deployment script. (I could probably
use the 'dotfiles' program for this now, but I didn't know about 'dotfiles'
then and this repo appears to predate it.)

Some configs reference excluded files ending in `.localonly`. These contain
authentication information, etc, and are .gitignore'd. They must be manually
added.

Some configs contain $USERNAME$, $PASSWORD$, and other pseudo-variables. You
must replace those manually. My local username is `mkelly`, and that is
floating around as well.

`initial_install_packages` contains a list of packages to be installed
(`deploy.sh` uses `apt` to install them). Lines beginning with `#` are
comments.
