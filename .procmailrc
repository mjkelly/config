# Replace $HOME/Msgs with your mailbox directory
# Mutt and elm use $HOME/Mail
# Pine uses $HOME/mail
# Netscape Messenger uses $HOME/nsmail
# Some NNTP clients, such as slrn & nn, use $HOME/News
# Mailboxes in maildir format are often put in $HOME/Maildir
# NOTE: Upon reading the next line, Procmail does a chdir to $MAILDIR
#       and relative paths are relative to $MAILDIR

# Make sure this directory exists!
